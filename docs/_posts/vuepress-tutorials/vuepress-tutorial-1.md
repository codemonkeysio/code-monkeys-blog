# VuePress Tutorial 1 - Introduction

:::

## What We'll be Developing

Welcome to our [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) series!

In this series we'll be developing the [Code Monkeys Blog](/) starting from the basics.

So, have a look around if you haven't already.

Now grab a üçå and let's get to it!

## Why Create a Blog?

- Benefits of creating a blog:

  - Learn how to Create a Website
  - Improve your Web Development Skills & Writing Ability
  - Document your Thoughts & Ideas
  - Help Others Learn & Meet New People
  - Build your Online Brand
  - Source of Independent Income
  - Show it to Employers

## What We'll be Covering

- Numerous [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) topics including:

  - Installation
  - Directory Structure
  - Configuration
  - Asset Handling
  - Markdown Extensions
  - Using [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) in Markdown
  - Deploying (Specifically to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/))
  - Frontmatter
  - Various Plugins:
    - <span class="external-link-wrap">[@vuepress/plugin-blog](https://vuepress-plugin-blog.billyyyyy3320.com/)</span>
    - <span class="external-link-wrap">[vuepress-plugin-mathjax](https://vuepress-community.netlify.app/plugins/mathjax/)</span>
    - <span class="external-link-wrap">[vuepress-plugin-code-copy](https://github.com/znicholasbrown/vuepress-plugin-code-copy)</span>
    - And More!

- More general Web Dev topics & tools including:

  - Favicons
  - Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs)
  - Images (Compression, Lazy Loading, etc.)
  - Embedding Videos
  - Responsive Design ([RFS](https://github.com/twbs/rfs), Videos, etc.)
  - Color Schemes
  - Gradients
  - Embeddable Interactive Code Editors ([codefence](https://codefence.io/))
  - OAuth Apps (Specifically for [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app))
  - And More!

## Nice to Know

Since [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), and Markdown, it's good to have a solid grasp of them before starting.

However, in these posts and the accompanying videos I'll try to explain everything in sufficient detail, and anything that may need more explanation I'll provide links to helpful resources.

## How to Use these Tutorials

- If you want to recreate the [Code Monkeys Blog](/) or create a very similar blog then you can simply follow these tutorials in order.

- Each tutorial will give you some general information about a [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) topic and provide helpful resources.

- Then we'll apply what we've learned to the blog as an example.

- This way you don't have to necessarily follow the tutorials in a linear order.

- You'll be able to just learn a [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) topic if you don't want to recreate the entire blog or create a very similar blog.

## Updates

Note that the [Code Monkeys Blog](/) is not a finished product.

This means new features will be added, and the current code will be optimized and refactored as needed.

So, when something gets updated a new post will be made discussing the changes and/or an old post may be updated.

Also, this blog is currently using [VuePress v1](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/).

[VuePress v2](https://v2.vuepress.vuejs.org/) is still in beta at the time of this writing.

Once [VuePress v2](https://v2.vuepress.vuejs.org/) is out of beta and the plugins being used are updated, the plan is to migrate over.

## Resources

- Each tutorial with code will have a corresponding branch which can be found here [code-monkeys-blog-tutorials](https://github.com/codemonkeysio/code-monkeys-blog-tutorials).

- The code for the current version of the blog can be found here [code-monkeys-blog](https://github.com/codemonkeysio/code-monkeys-blog).
