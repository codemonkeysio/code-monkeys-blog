## Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)

</div>

‚ÄúFree software‚Äù means software that respects users' freedom and community. Roughly, it means that the users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change, and improve the software.

"Open source software" also gives the users the ability to run, copy, distribute, study, change, and improve the software; however, it does not share the same goal of making sure the software that is being developed is actually attempting to improve users' freedom.

## Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays (Nostr)

</div>

The simplest open protocol that is able to create a censorship-resistant global "social" network once and for all.

It doesn't rely on any trusted central server, hence it is resilient; it is based on cryptographic keys and signatures, so it is tamperproof; it does not rely on peer-to-peer (P2P) techniques, and therefore it works.
