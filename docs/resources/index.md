# Giving Credit to the Great <div class="emoji-wrap">Apes!!! ü¶ç üçå üêí</div>

:::

Here you'll find a list of topics I'm interested in presented in alphabetical order. The goal of providing resources for these topics is to help people learn more about programming as well as to provide people with free and open source software that also respects their privacy.

Moving over to using only free and open source software that also respects users' privacy is a process, so don't feel like you have to switch everything at once. I'm still using proprietary software that doesn't respect users' privacy, and I may continue to do so if I feel the pros outweigh the cons. However, over time if possible I would prefer to phase out all of the proprietary software I'm using.

While I believe these links are to resources that will help you gain a better conceptual and practical understanding of the topics, I haven't personally used and verified all of these resources. Be sure to do your own research and always double check the links are bringing you to the correct sites, especially when dealing with a site related to privacy or finances. Don't trust, verify.

I'll be updating these resources from time to time, so if you have any suggestions on how to improve them let me know.

## Bitcoin

</div>

"The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that‚Äôs required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust." - Satoshi Nakamoto

Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that enables instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer (P2P) technology to operate with no central authority: transaction management and money issuance are carried out collectively by the network.

## Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)

</div>

‚ÄúFree software‚Äù means software that respects users' freedom and community. Roughly, it means that the users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change, and improve the software.

"Open source software" also gives the users the ability to run, copy, distribute, study, change, and improve the software; however, it does not share the same goal of making sure the software that is being developed is actually attempting to improve users' freedom.

## Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays (Nostr)

</div>

The simplest open protocol that is able to create a censorship-resistant global "social" network once and for all.

It doesn't rely on any trusted central server, hence it is resilient; it is based on cryptographic keys and signatures, so it is tamperproof; it does not rely on peer-to-peer (P2P) techniques, and therefore it works.
